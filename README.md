Loading and looking at data back to 1997 for number of visas for different categories issued from the US department of state, by country. Data is from the State Department's webiste, [here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-statistics/nonimmigrant-visa-statistics.html), and from the National Science Foundation's Survey of Earned Doctorates (SEDS). State data are downloaded and cleaned in the first Stata file; SEDS data are downloaded in the Jupyter Notebook file.
