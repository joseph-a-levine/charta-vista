Analysis of U.S. visa issuance for graduate level education and program choice. Scraping in Python; analysis in Stata.

# Data
Data on visa issuance from the State Department, [here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-statistics/nonimmigrant-visa-statistics.html). 

Data on Ph.D. program choice and demographics from the National Science Foundation's Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED).
