Analysis of U.S. visa issuance for graduate level education and program choice. Scraping in Python; analysis in Stata.

# Data
Data on visa issuance from the State Department, [here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-statistics/nonimmigrant-visa-statistics.html). Many data files have been removed or archived in the past few years; please see the Web Archive if any of the linked files are not available.

Data on Ph.D. program choice and demographics from the National Science Foundation's Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED).

State Department data are downloaded and cleaned in the first Stata file; SED data are downloaded in the Jupyter Notebook file.

# Analysis

Some analysis files removed 2020-10-03, as I'm now turning this into a more formal write-up. Please contact me jablevine@gmail.com if you have any questions. This has implications for PhD applicants in social sciences in the US, foreign and domestic. 

I also used some of these data in forecasting tournaments, notably CSET.
